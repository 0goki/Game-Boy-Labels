A bunch of Game Boy labels and stickers that I redrew and recreated in Adobe Illustrator for refurbishing Gameboys

>[!TIP]
> Holographic labels are made using printable holographic sticker sheet with clear waterproof laminate. Cuts are made with Cricut Explorer 4 using **Print then Cut** at **250 PRESSURE** and **2x PASS**

>[!Caution]
> Circut Design Space seems to export prints at only 300dpi. Recommend exporting the print file to PDF and overlay/replace with 2400dpi version of the graphic and then print rather than printing directly from CDS.
